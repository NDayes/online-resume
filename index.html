        <img src="./assets/headshot.png" alt="resume headshot" height=150 />
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As an accomplished and self-driven professional, I possess 8 years of experience in project management, 
            app support, marketing, events, and service. As a customer success manager, I offer guidance and project consultation,
            enabling client to best utilise tech solutions to suit their needs. In addition my role in prouct testing enables me
            to identify issues as well as areas for improvement and better UX.
        </p>    
        <p>My passion lies in all things creative and digital, but through my career into the events technology space, 
            I have found a passion and a drive to understand the mechanics of how things are built from the ground up.
            I love to come up with new ideas and find out of the box solutions, and the more I looked into coding to help identify bugs and fix them,
            the more I realised that i'd live to learn more in order to innovate the solutions from scratch myself.
        </p>     
        <p>I am now currently studying to become a fullstack developer, via a hihgly accredited course. I am excited to build my portfolio as I continue to learn and grow,
            and to see how this can further aid my consumer centric approach as I aim to help my company further innovate and perfect tech solutions.
