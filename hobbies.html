    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Things I love outside of work</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Music
            <p>This i'd have to say is my oldest and deepest love. I think i've gone full circle, 
                as although I have gone down the rabbit whole of tech, my natural love and ability for the creative flow, 
                i've found to be highly transferrable. I still ove music and attempting to write, 
                and its something i'll always love to do on the side, merely for the love of it all</p>
        </li>
        <li>Creating Videos
            <p> I just love taking the raw materials, and turning it into something much richer. 
                This can be as simple as turning a few short clips into a day in the life, product haul, 
                or can be turning memories from day trips and festivals into brighter videos, 
                that I can look back on and remember that moment in time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Movies
            <p>Self explanatory really, I do love a good movie!</p>
        </li>
        <li>Yoga
            <p>This is one i've let slip a little, but there is something to be said for any mindfulness practice 
                that works for you. I like the added physical benefits, but it gives me a moment of reflection 
                and a useful break from daily stresses</p>
        </li>
        <li>Gym
            <p>A new love for me but one i've quickly gotten into. Like many i'd been to the gym before, 
                but this time feels different. I'm on a new health journey and the mental benefits 
                far outway anything else for me. I feel stronger both in mind and body, 
                and i've gained an extra sense of self confidence and belief in what I can do. 
                It't weird how things can trasnfer over into other aspects of life so much, 
                but this is my way of reminding myself that I can do far more than I thought. 
                I've gotten into weight and can proudly say this girl can lift!
                So when the world tells you can't do something, don't listen.
